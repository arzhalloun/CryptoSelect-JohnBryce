My second project for John Bryce fullstack class using HTML, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, AJAX, REST API, & BOOTSTRAP.

Some of the features that can be found in CryptoSelect include:

Coin of interest selection by toggle switch.
Expandable information per coin on the homepage.
Search Capabilities.
2 APIs used for information retrieval:
https://www.coingecko.com/api
https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/
To get started, feel free to select up to 5 coins to display in the live report. If you would like to choose a sixth, you'll have to replace one of your currently selected coins with a new one.
